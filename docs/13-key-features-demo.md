## 💻 Code Review Section (3-5 minutes)

### **Code Snippet 1: Security Implementation**
```php
// Show this code from functions.php
function cleanUserInput($user_input) {
    $cleaned_data = trim($user_input);
    $cleaned_data = stripslashes($cleaned_data);
    $cleaned_data = htmlspecialchars($cleaned_data);
    return $cleaned_data;
}

// And this from any page with database queries
$user_email = cleanUserInput($_POST["email"]);
$user_query = "SELECT * FROM CLIENT WHERE email = ?";
$user_statement = mysqli_prepare($conn, $user_query);
mysqli_stmt_bind_param($user_statement, "s", $user_email);
```

**🗣️ Explain:**
"Every user input is sanitized to prevent XSS attacks, and all database 
queries use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection."

### **Code Snippet 2: Business Logic**
```php
// Show this from functions.php
function checkCarAvailability($car_id, $start_date, $end_date, $connection) {
    $availability_query = "SELECT id_reservation 
                          FROM RESERVATION 
                          WHERE id_voiture = ? 
                          AND ((date_debut BETWEEN ? AND ?) 
                              OR (date_fin BETWEEN ? AND ?) 
                              OR (date_debut <= ? AND date_fin >= ?))";
    // ... rest of function
}
```

**🗣️ Explain:**
"This function prevents double-booking by checking for three types of 
date conflicts. It's the core business logic that ensures data integrity."

### **Code Snippet 3: Database Design**
```sql
-- Show this database structure
CREATE TABLE `reservation` (
  `id_reservation` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `id_client` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `date_debut` date DEFAULT NULL,
  `date_fin` date DEFAULT NULL,
  `id_voiture` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (`id_client`) REFERENCES `client` (`id_client`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`id_voiture`) REFERENCES `voiture` (`id_voiture`)
);
```

**🗣️ Explain:**
"The database uses proper normalization with foreign key relationships 
to maintain data integrity and eliminate redundancy."
